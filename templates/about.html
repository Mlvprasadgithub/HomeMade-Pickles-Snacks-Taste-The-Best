        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Founded with a mission to preserve and share the rich culinary heritage of India, HomeMade Pickles & Snacks began as a small family kitchen operation. Our journey started when we realized that the authentic taste of traditional pickles and snacks was becoming increasingly rare in today's fast-paced world.</p>
            
            <p>Every product we create is a labor of love, made using the finest ingredients sourced directly from local farmers. We believe in maintaining the authenticity of traditional recipes while ensuring the highest standards of hygiene and quality.</p>
            
            <p>Our cloud-based platform revolutionizes access to authentic, handcrafted pickles and snacks, combining artisanal craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology to deliver farm-fresh flavors directly to your doorstep.</p>
